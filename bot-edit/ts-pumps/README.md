# TeamSkeet Pumps -> Women's Heels

TeamSkeet's use of [Pumps](https://www.teamskeet.com/search?filter=%22Pumps%22&page=0) refers to the shoes and has flooded the tag with incorrect entries. I have not seen a corrent use of Pump (Suction) for any teamskeet sub-studios yet, they seem to all refer to the Shoes.

A [PR (#2082)](https://github.com/stashapp/CommunityScrapers/pull/2082) was created to replace it in CommunityScrapers, this script manually searches for instances and replaces them

Brought up [here](https://discord.com/channels/559159668438728723/935611121371611157/1299977770620817419) and [discussed](https://discord.com/channels/559159668438728723/935611121371611157/1301416399964602418)

```
TeamSkeet uses Pumps to refer to the shoes which conflicts with the StashDB alias. A CommunityScripts PR was merged but the remnants are being cleaned up. See https://feederbox.cc/gh/misc-projects/tree/main/ts-pumps
